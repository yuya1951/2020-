TOKYO -- On a late October weekday in the resort village of Karuizawa in the central Japan prefecture of Nagano, six men and women gathered around a wood-burning stove in a luxurious home, engaging in lighthearted conversation.

"When you're having a meeting on Zoom, sometimes you get the chirping of birds in the background, and get reactions from others, don't you?"

"Right, like when you're working on the terrace."

The six are from various backgrounds -- a company manager, an advertising agency employee, a university professor -- and have residences or holiday homes in Karuizawa. Their conversation gets going when they focus on things they have in common in their day-to-day lives since moving to the town.

"If you spend one hour commuting, it means you'll spend years in a train (over the course of your life). Here your home and work are adjacent, so your work is part of your daily life. It not a competitive situation where it's either work or life. In a city, you might have crowds, but you can still be lonely," one of the six remarks.

Tomoya Shiraishi, the 57-year-old president of an investment company, bought a property in Karuizawa this summer as a place to settle down in the future. He has previously lived in Silicon Valley in the United States, as well as in Singapore and Tokyo. After the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, he has split his time between Karuizawa and the capital -- "about 80% here and 20% in Tokyo," he says.

"As long as I can establish a relationship with my clients, I can talk with them online regardless of the time and place. It has hardly any effect on my work. I should have come here sooner," Shiraishi says. The others in the group nod in agreement.

Referring to the upscale Azabu district of Tokyo's Minato Ward, owners of prime properties in Karuizawa say that the area has become a "Kita-Azabu," or "northern Azabu," of sorts. Located about 130 kilometers away from the heart of Tokyo, a community resembling that of Tokyo's Nishi-Azabu district, where high-income earners gather, is spreading its roots.

As a representative resort area, Karuizawa has been beloved as a place for social exchange, with industrialist Eiichi Shibusawa of the Meiji era (1868-1912) among the managers who came to the area. In recent years it has drawn people who are tired of life in the city and want to settle there, surrounded by nature. While Nagano Prefecture's population is decreasing, in general the population and number of households in the Karuizawa area are slowly increasing.

The coronavirus pandemic has sped up the flow toward a "new normal" lifestyle with the spread of telework and other changes. Real estate prices in popular areas in Karuizawa have surged, and there are two-month waits to get optic fiber communications connections set up. This "corona bubble," in the words of a town tourism official, has spread to neighboring local bodies, too.

Looking at monthly population movement statistics for Nagano Prefecture, it is evident that more than 1,000 people moved to Karuizawa and the neighboring town of Miyota from outside the prefecture between April and September this year. Including people like Shiraishi who choose not to transfer their resident registers to Karuizawa but retain a base in another area, the actual number of people who have "moved" to the area is even higher.

Kanichi Suzuki, a specially appointed professor at Shinshu University in Nagano Prefecture, who serves as a director of a general incorporated association and is also partially based in Tokyo, says that since the outbreak of COVID-19, interest in "evacuating" from urban areas has been high. He adds, "Interest in moving that had been heightened as a result of work style reform is actually materializing as a result of the coronavirus. Even after the infections are brought under control, this major trend won't change."

The Mainichi Shimbun answers some common questions readers may have about taking a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the coronavirus at their own expense and how much it costs.

Question: How do you receive a PCR test for COVID-19 privately?

Answer: There are two main ways a person can get tested for the coronavirus. If a doctor decides that an individual who was at a cluster infection site or who has symptoms such as a fever needs to get tested, they can receive an administrative test at public expense based on the infectious diseases control law. Meanwhile, medical institutions and test kit manufacturers provide an opportunity for people to get tested, but they will have to pay for it out of their own pocket.

Q: How much does it cost to get tested at your own expense?

A: On average, it costs around 20,000 to 40,000 yen (about $192 to $383) to get checked at a medical institution, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. If a person directly applies to a test kit company, it costs anywhere between 2,000 ($19.17) and 20,000 yen (about $192).

Q Why do some people want to get tested even though it's that expensive?

A: A business person who travels abroad may for example be required to submit a certificate of a negative test result at their destination. There is also demand from people who want to avoid spreading infections on occasions where people come together, such as weddings or gatherings with relatives, by getting tested before the event.

Q: Should we feel assured if we test negative?

A: Not always. The accuracy of PCR tests varies depending on the manufacturer, and even a person who has tested negative has a risk of becoming infected later on. A person who applied with a kit manufacturer and tested positive after paying for a test does not have to submit their results to a public health center, meaning that there is a danger that the local government cannot accurately know the infection situation. The health ministry is calling on people to consult a public health center or visit a medical institution if they test positive.
